<h1>Data Visualization Myth</h1>
<p> Using graphics to visaulize data is a new and popular way to represent the complicated information nowadays. 
  However, it is very easy to make mistake when transforming data into a graph. 
  The following image is one of the misleading and bad example.

<p>The above graph has the 2 problems: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The scale on Y-axis is not integers which are uncommon to express age. </li>
    <li>The graph is unnecessary as it just saying every province's age is 19 except three where it's 18. </li>
  </ol>
